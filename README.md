## Description

### What is USDT flashing?

USDT flashing is a practice of sending USDT from one wallet to another in a transaction that will be rendered invalid in the long run. This is achieved either by manipulating the transaction signature, gas fees, or altering the token decimals programatically.

### USDT flashing software

Coin Flashr is a USDT flashing software that lets users perform BTC and USDT flashing transactions with multiple variants of Bitcoin (including Bitcoin Fantom and Wrapped Bitcoin) and USDT (ERC20, BEP20, and TRC20).  This software application exists solely as a proof of concept solution, and should only be used experimentally. The setup and utilization is entirely dummyproof. Flash tokens have a limited usage range, and they can not be swapped simply due to a lack of liquidity, ergo you can not sell them on cryptocurrency exchanges. That simply does not exist. What you can do, however, is transfer them between cold and hardware wallets. Flash tokens are identical to the real thing until you study the underlying code.

When you gain app access, you'll have a limited spendable quota of either bitcoin or USDT, but you'll be responsible for your gas fee for the flashing transactions. You'll find a gas address in-app and the gas topup process is simple.
